# coding-dojo
My coding practices around topics such as data structures and algorithms, JavaScript and C#.

Here's the directory structure and how to run each project:
- __/leetcode__: my [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) solutions, in C# and JavaScript
  - /csharp-solutions: ./LeetCodeSolutions.Tests/dotnet test
  - /javascript-solutions: node 1-two-sum.js
- __/others__
  - /__javascript-interview-questions__: npm t
  - /__msgpack-lite-sandbox__: node index.js
- __/udemy__: exercises from the [Udemy](https://udemy.com) courses I'm taking
  - __C# Advanced Topics: Prepare for Technical Interviews__, /csharp-advanced: ./CSharpAdvanced.Test/dotnet test
  - __Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms in Java__, /ds-and-a
    - /csharp-solutions: ./DSAndA.Test/dotnet test
    - /javascript-solutions: npm t
